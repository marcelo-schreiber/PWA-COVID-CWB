<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

There are many COVID-19 APIs, however, none of them hand detailed data, in a open-source way, from my city (Curitiba A.K.A cwb).

Why?

* Curitiba citizens must know how this disease is being handled over time.

* The time for creating apps or websites about this subject can be highly demanding. This project can save a lot of that work.

Needless to say, this API is very focused on my local region. So you may also suggest changes by forking this repo and creating a pull request or opening an issue.
